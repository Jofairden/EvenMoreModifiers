The following document describes how this project is 'license free' and what that entails.
The main purpose of this document is to clarify that despite there being no license, copyright laws still apply.

Even More Modifiers is what's called "license free"
License-free software is computer software that is not explicitly in the public domain, but the software owner has not made explicit the terms of the license which makes the software fully copyright protected according to the Berne convention.

When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. 
Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify the work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. 
Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.
Even in the absence of a license file, you may grant some rights in cases where you publish your source code to a site that requires accepting terms of service. 
For example, if you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub (like Even More Modifiers), you have accepted the Terms of Service, by which you allow others to view and fork your repository. 
Others may not need your permission if limitations and exceptions to copyright apply to their particular situation. 
Neither site terms nor jurisdiction-specific copyright limitations are sufficient for the kinds of collaboration that people usually seek on a public code host, such as experimentation, modification, and sharing as fostered by an open source license.

Copyright is a legal right, existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others.
This is usually only for a limited time. 
The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. 
A major limitation on copyright on ideas is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.
The gist of this is that YOU CAN NOT copyright ideas.

Copyright IS NOT the same as a patent or trademark.
Copyright protects original works of authorship created by you. 
A patent protects inventions and useful discoveries. 
Trademark protects distinctive words, phrases, symbols, sounds and designs. 
Trademarks identify and distinguish the source of the goods (and services) of one party from those of another party.
