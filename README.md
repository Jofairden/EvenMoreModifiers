# EvenMoreModifiers
This mod adds an additional 'modifier' system for items, allowing them to roll modifying effects that can give various bonuses to the owner. These effects can roll on weapons, accessories and armor. (vanity is excluded) This system goes on top of prefixes, that means you can still use vanilla prefixes to full benefit.

# Community Creation
With the new system, you can easily create your own new modifiers. I highly suggest you take a look at some of the existing modifiers first, so you can get a feel for how the classes are laid out. You can also create your own rarities and pools. Pools are meant to roll 'themed' items, so for example a pool could only exist of frost- or ice-like effects and only roll on a specific set of themed items (winter event anyone?) My hope is that people come up with their own addition mods, that make full benefit of the new system by adding new pools, rarities and modifiers. Of course, existing mods can add as well, such as big content mods like Calamity or Thorium.

How to make your own content is described in [this document](https://hackmd.io/s/Hy7uWULiG)

Unfortunately hiccup has left the scene now almost a year ago, he kindly requested I kept the mod alive.

Massive thanks to thegamemaster1234 for migrating a lot of already existing modifiers to the new system!

Thanks chicken-bones for some great insights how to approach things
